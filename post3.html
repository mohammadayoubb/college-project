            <h3>Learn Artificial Intelligence in the easiest way</h3>
            <p>
                artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot
                 to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied 
                 to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of
                  humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.
                   Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers
                  can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for
                 mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing 
                 advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that 
                 can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge.
                  On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and 
                    professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is
                       found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting 
                       recognition.

            There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.

            To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either deductive or inductive. An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute assurance. Inductive reasoning is common in science, where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in mathematics and logic, where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules.

There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences, especially deductive inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences; it involves drawing inferences relevant to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI.
